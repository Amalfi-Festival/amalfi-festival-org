## Transportation to Italy

Is air travel included in the program cost?
: No, that cost is independent. 
 
What airport/city should I fly into?
:Naples is the closest city to the Amalfi Coast with an international airport. The drive from the Naples airport to the festival can take 60 to 90 minutes, depending on traffic. If you prefer to fly into Rome, you must transfer to the downtown train station and take a train (approx. a 3-hour trip on Frecciarossa) to Naples. In Naples you will need to get a public bus to Maiori or else get a taxi to the Naples airport to join the group waiting for the festival shuttle bus. Otherwise, take a train to Salerno, the town closest to our facilities, where you can take a public bus (40 mins) to Maiori or arrange a private pick-up at the train station for approx. 80 euros. Night rates apply. 

How do I get from the airport to the festival?
: The festival provides a morning and afternoon bus for each program's arrival and departure dates. The time of the buses is scheduled to accommodate the greatest number of flights and is announced in June. You may also request a private transfer (independent car with driver) to or from the airport for a fee, which is a less expensive option that taking a taxi. Cost of private transfer is approx. $150 although rates may vary and a surcharge is added for night transfers (9 p.m. - 6:00 a.m.)

## Arrival/Departure
 
What time should I arrive and depart?  
: You are invited to arrive any time after 12 p.m. noon on arrival day. We recommend you plan to arrive by 5 p.m. in order to attend an orientation. A welcome dinner is scheduled the first night for people on the meal plan although others may sign up to join that evening. On departure day you are expected to leave in the morning. Most international flights leave Naples very early. Hotel and hostel check-out times are generally 10:00 a.m.
 
 
Can I come a day or two early or stay on after the festival? 
: We are not able to book accommodations for extra days before or after the program although you are welcome to make independent arrangements. 

## Everyday Concerns
 
Do I need to bring any electrical appliances, such as a hairdryer?
: We recommend you leave most electrical appliances at home. All accommodations (hotels and hostel) restrict the use of irons due to fire hazards. Electric water boilers are strictly prohibited.  Please note you will need a transformer  current as well as an adaptor plug to fit into the wall outlet (adaptors can also be found locally in hardware stores).
 
What kind of internet service is there in the town?
: All accommodations have wireless service. The service can sometimes be inconsistent due to the position of the town between the mountains and the sea. 
 
What kind of laundry facilities are there?
: There are two laundromats in the town in close proximity.  There is a dry cleaners that will do basic laundry (cost determined by the kilo) but it can take several days.  Many people do handwash in their sinks.  
 
How do I obtain cash?
: There are several ATM machines in town(called a Bancomat) to access money with your credit card. Be sure to check about fees associated with your credit card for international transactions.

## What to Bring

Carry-on Luggage
: We strongly recommend you pack a basic over-night bag as part of your carry-on luggage with a change of clothes, sleepwear, basic toiletries, medications, and any other essentials you might need. In today's travel climate,  the occasional experienced serious problems with baggage handling, resulting in many late arrivals of luggage for our group (for the unlucky few, some bags arrive 3 or 4 days late). You may save yourself a lot of discomfort and anxiety by taking this precaution!  Also, make a photocopy of your passport and tuck it into your carry-on bag to have a record of it.
 
 
Clothing
: Be prepared to bring clothes for hot weather and a bathing suit for the beach. Dress during the day is informal. Keep in mind,that Italians don't usually wear shorts. Women will feel most comfortable in sun dresses or summery skirts and tops. For evenings, be prepared to dress for concerts. Please note: No shorts or tank tops are permitted in the hotel dining area at dinner.
 
Performers
: Men are expected to perform in dress shirt while women should plan to appear in dressy summery attire. Please be sure to bring appropriate dress shoes. 

Beach & Pool Wear
: In addition to a bathing suit, a “cover-up” is a good idea so you can walk down to the beach. Be sure to pack hats & sunscreen for the dazzling Mediterranean sun!
 
Shoes
: Both men and women who will be performing should  have dress shoes (or sandals for women.).
 
Everyday shoes
: Because you will doing a lot of walking between the hotel and practice facilities, we recommend a pair of comfortable shoes or sandals. The Amalfi Coast is hilly terrain so be prepared to get some exercise, especially on excursion days.
 
    For the beach, it is advisable to have some kind of water shoe to wear into the water because the rocky Amalfi Coast has pebble beaches which can be uncomfortable on bare feet.
 
Medications/Health
: All medications should be packed in your carry-on luggage so that you take no risk in losing them . Additionally, you should keep a detailed list of any prescription medications you rely on (in case of loss) plus the phone numbers of your physician. Your health insurance policy information should also be readily available.
 
Appliances & Converters
 Please note that irons and water boilers are not permitted in the hotel rooms due to fire regulations. If absolutely necessary, keep in mind that for small appliances like electric razors, you will need a standard converter for European voltage (110: 220). You will also need a plug adapter to enable the U.S. plug to fit the standard Italian model (a plug with two round prongs). There are small, portable “travel hair-dryers" equipped with dual voltage to eliminate the need for a converter although you will still need an adapter.
 

## Meals

Do you recommend signing up for the Meal Plan?
: While you are free to eat on your own, we do strongly recommend you consider the festival Meal Plan. Due to our concert schedule, it is more convenient to eat with the group at specially arranged times when local restaurants are not always open. The festival dinners also provide an important time to socialize with other festival participants and faculty.
 
If I'm on the Meal Plan, what happens when we go to other towns for concerts?
: For those on the Meal Plan, we arrange to eat together in a local trattoria or restaurant for a delicious 3-course meal when we are in a different town for a performance.
 
 
What other options exist for eating in the town?
: In Maiori there is an array of small restaurants, cafes, and pizzerias all within walking distance.
 
Does the Meal Plan offer options for Vegetarians?
: Yes.

## Hotel

Do all Hotels have private bathrooms? 
Yes.
 
What do you mean by triple occupancy?
: The standard option for students is a shared room with three (3) beds. Double and single rooms are also available for a supplemental cost.

## Hostel: 

What are the hostel accommodtions like?
: The hostel accommodations vary from year to year. They are generally dormitory-style accommodations with shared rooms, simple furnishings, and a shared bathroom. Central air conditioning may be limited to smaller units.  No breakfast is included. 
 

## Insurance

Why do you recommend travel insurance?
: Each year we have at least one last-minute cancellation, due to unexpected health problems or family schedule changes. At such a late date it is impossible for us (or the airlines) to provide a full refund. Travel insurance provides important protection for unexpected situations, cancellations, lost luggage, etc.
See listing of travel insurance agencies.
 
Does my health insurance cover me in Italy?
: You need to check your policy carefully to understand what kind of international coverage your provider offers. If there is any doubt, we recommend you consider a short-term policy for travel abroad to have a guarantee of coverage.
