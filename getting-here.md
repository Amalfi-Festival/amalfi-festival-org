## Getting here

### Travel by air from Naples airport

The Festival supplies complimentary transportation (via shuttle bus) between the Naples Airport (Capodochino) and our facilities in Maiori on arrival and departure dates for all our programs. A late-morning bus and several afternoon buses are available. The timing is determined by the flight information from our participants and guests and regulated by the schedule of international flights. If you are flying in or departing at a different time, we are happy to help set up independent airport transportation arrangements and provide an estimate for that service.

### Travel by train from Salerno Railway Station

If you opt to fly into another Italian city, such as Rome or Milan, and continue south by train, you should book your arrival for the Salerno
railway station instead of Naples.  The Salerno station is closer and more accessible than the chaotic and congested station in Naples. We can arrange a transfer for you at the Salerno train station only.  There are many routes to Salerno from major Italian cities.

## Airlines

All participants are free to make their travel plans at their own discretion. There are many efficient search engines and websites with a range of flights and prices, such as: www.kayak.com, expedia.com, etc.
 
For arrival at the festival, your most convenient option is to fly into the city of Naples, which is approximately 90 minutes from our facilities. There are few direct flights from the U.S. to Naples outside of New York. Lufthansa (Star Alliance) and Air France (SkyTeam Alliance) have consistently offered reliable routes at the best prices.
 
Keep in mind that ticket prices are subject to change until the time you actually purchase your ticket so it is wise to act quickly once you have found the best itinerary.

For your protection, we strongly recommend you purchase travel insurance. In case of a health problem or family emergency that might require you to make a last-minute change in plans. Although on-line search engine such as Kayak or Orbitz, usually offer an option to purchase travel insurance to cover your flight, we recommend a more extensive coverage that would cover your program fees, should you have to cancel unexpectedly.
