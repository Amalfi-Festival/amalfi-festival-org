The Writing Program invites participants to find inspiration in the landscape and character of a region known for attracting generations of writers and artists.

Participants will reflect on a range of writings by authors such as John Steinbeck and Virginia Woolf and paintings by artists like John Singer Sargent and M.C. Escher that capture the singular beauty and history of Amalfi, Ravello, Positano and more. The key themes and perspectives of these writings and art works will offer vivid prompts crafted by the instructor for the participants' own creative and reflective writing.

Participants will tour many of the places that inspired writers and artists of the past, writing in gardens, lemon tree groves and cafes as they respond to the landscape, architecture and art that surrounds them.  An informal reading for course participants and guests will conclude the session.
