class-name: Exploring Watercolor

Capture the essence of the beautiful Amalfi Coast in watercolor! Participants in this painting course will be encouraged to create plein air drawings, sketches and studies using the local scenery as inspiration, then return to the studio to further develop their reference material into completed paintings. This approach combines the immediacy of plein air drawing with the more deliberate studio approach.
 
Watercolor paintings can be so much more than a checklist of watercolor technique. David goes beyond the basics of paint application, and teaches how to construct strong, vibrant, personality-filled paintings. David shows how to carefully construct a watercolor using preliminary sketches and value studies. David will also demonstrate his method of using multiple glazes of wet-into-wet passages to achieve unsurpassed brilliance as well as the use of masking agents to achieve jewel-like clarity. Participants will work from their own personal photographs or sketches.
