# Program structure

/\_programs/
    PROGRAM-NAME.md - main page for the specific program
        the name of the program MUST be all lower case, with spaces replaced with hyphens (e.g., "visual-arts.md", NOT "visual arts.md" or "Visual-Arts.md").
    When a program is no longer active, it is best to either remove the file or move it to another temporary directory. I suggest creating /\_programs\_inactive/ as a directory right next to /\_programs/, and moving the file there.
/assets/programs/PROGRAM-NAME
    home.jpg - used on the home page as the "hero image" representing the program


# Faculty

/\_faculty/
    FIRST-LAST.md - please use proper capitalization. The filename (without the extension) is used when specifying faculty for specific sessions.
/assets/faculty/
    Contains all images representing faculty. Referenced in each .md file above.
