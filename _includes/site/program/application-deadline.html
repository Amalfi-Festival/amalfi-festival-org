Creates HTML representing the application deadline.

By default it will use the information in `festival.yaml`. If an |application| object exists in
|reference-program| it will use that instead. It will also accept an |application| object directly.

All relevant items are expected to be in the application object. It will not, for example, use the
deposit in one object, and then the deadline in another if it isn't specified.
