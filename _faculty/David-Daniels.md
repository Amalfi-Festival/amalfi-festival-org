David Daniels' large impressionistic paintings have won him recognition through out the United States and numerous awards. David moved to Washington DC in 1983 to pursue a full time career as an artist, after teaching art in the Michigan public school system for over fifteen years. David helped establish the Boat House Art School, in Rock Creek Park, where he then took on the position of Co-director. Currently he is  the  watercolor instructor for the Studio Arts Program of the Smithsonian Institution of Washington DC.  He also teaches design and painting at Montgomery College in Rockville, MD, as well as conducting workshops across the U.S. and around the world.

David is much sought after for his comprehensive and accessible writing on painting. He has had numerous articles published in ”American Artist Magazine” and was featured prominently in “Exploring Color” by Nita Leland. He is also the author of a book, Watercolor Journeys, widely acclaimed for the artist and the lay-person alike.

David is strongly committed to the notion that planning does not destroy spontaneity but rather creates opportunities. David demonstrates how to carefully construct a watercolor using preliminary sketches and value studies on gray paper that eventually are transferred to watercolor paper.   He elects for his students to work from sketches, photographs and other source material. David believes this process allows for stronger compositions, and therefore, stronger paintings.
