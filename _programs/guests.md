## Soak up the magical atmosphere!

Friends and family members of Institute participants are invited to visit the festival as part of our Guest Program.

Guests may also sign up for an array of excursions to world-renowned destinations such as Pompeii, Naples, Capri. Guests will also join performing artists to travel to concerts in towns such as Amalfi, Ravello, Maiori, and other scenic locations. Other possible side trips may include a boat trip to Positano, the Greek temples at Paestum, and the 12th century Benedictine abbey of Cava de' Tirreni.
