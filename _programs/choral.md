You are invited to join fellow choristers for an unforgettable
singing-vacation in Maiori, Italy!  Bring family members and friends along to
enjoy this unique experience.  Instrumentalists who wish to participate in
the orchestra are also encouraged to join the trip.

Our 27th season will feature the **Arioso Chorale** from Washington D.C under
the baton of **Paul Leavitt**, joined by members of the **National
Philharmonic Chorale** with **Stan Engebretson**, Artistic Director.  Other
singers are invited to participate.

During the festival, singers will have the exciting opportunity to perform
the **Requiem** by Paul Leavitt with orchestra, plus other classics of choral
repertoire, at historic cloisters and cathedrals on the Amalfi Coast.  Here
you can experience sacred music in the spaces it was created for.
