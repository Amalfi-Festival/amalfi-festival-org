Join fellow choristers for an unforgettable singing-vacation in Maiori, Italy!
Bring family members and friends along to enjoy this unique experience.  

Our 2024 season will feature members of the **Baltimore Choral Arts Society**
under the baton of **Anthony Blake Clark**, Music Director, joined
by **National Philharmonic Chorale** alums with **Stan Engebretson**,
Conductor Laureate.  Other singers are invited to participate.

During the festival, singers will have the opportunity to perform the classics
of choral repertoire at historic cloisters and cathedrals on the Amalfi
Coast.  Here you can experience sacred music in the spaces it was created
for. 

## Trip Highlights

Two concerts:

- Perform Vivaldi's ***Gloria*** and cathedral choral classics in the historic
  Basilica San Giovanni di Napoli for a gala concert sponsored by the
  International Rotary Club of Naples.  An Italian chorus has been invited to
  join us.
- Celebrate the 4th of July with a memorable concert --- **Independence Day
  Americana** --- with  Broadway hits, patriotic songs, and spirituals in the
  enchanting gardens of the Palazzo Mezzacapo --- a much anticipated evening
  for  our Italian audiences!

Tour renowned cultural landmarks and stunning landscapes:

- Explore  this  magnificent  area   of  the Mediterranean,  where for
  centuries artists and musicians have come for inspiration and to soak up
  the beauty --- from the lush vineyards and terraced lemon groves to the
  rocky buffs and vivid sea. Visit some of the world's most dramatic sights:
  the haunting excavations of Pompeii, the magical island of Capri, the
  majesty of Ravello's villas, and more.
