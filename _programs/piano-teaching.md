The Amalfi Coast observes the Siesta Hour, a unique practice in the Mediterranean region. During the peak of the day at noon, most shops and restaurants close as our piano master class takes place in the air-conditioned hall. Following the lunch break, the Mediterranean town comes alive with vibrant nightlife. After group formal dinners and daily concerts, professors and students often gather to enjoy drinks at a seaside restaurant. If fortunate, you might also catch a spectacular fireworks show in a nearby town by the sea.

Driving through Mamma Mia while listening to Debussy's piano prelude "The Hill of Anacapri" creates a captivating experience, transitioning from serenity to exhilaration. Taking the cable car to the summit of Anacapri, you'll be surrounded by the enchanting color #0476D0, known as Capri Blue.

Beyond its mesmerizing beauty, Capri stands among the world's top ten most expensive resorts. Laden with luxury stores and exclusive five-star hotels, securing a room can be a challenge. In 29 BC, the esteemed Augustus the Great was willing to exchange an island several times to gain access to Capri.

As part of the Seminar, the one-day tour to Capri for participants includes ferry tickets, entry passes, and the guided tour service.

Ravello, renowned as the "City of Music," hosts the Ravello Festival, frequently graced by conductor Muti, at the enchanting Villa Rufolo. Ravello served as an inspiration for Wagner's opera Parsifal and is a musical shrine revered by Liszt.

During the Seminar, the half-day tour to Ravello offers participants a guided tour, ensuring a leisurely and delightful musical exploration.
